        <h3> About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Tabitha, and I've been learning web design since I was 13 years old. I was in the eighth grade
            when my computer science teacher started teaching us how to create basic html web pages using tables to hold the content.
            I immediately fell in love with this, and started using what he taught us in my MySpace layouts. When MySpace went quiet,
            that was the end of me using HTML on a daily basis, until I enrolled in the local Career Tech High School where
            I took a class called Digital Design. In this class, we learned graphic design, video and web design. In my class,
            I was the only student who had previous experience with HTML, so I quickly picked up what she taught us, and I
            excelled in the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            After high school, I attended The School of Advertising Art in Kettering Ohio, where I learned more about graphic
            design, photography video and web design. Half way through my first year, the web design teacher was offered
            his dream job, and put in his resignation at the school. He was replaced with the adjunct teacher who taught
            the typography course. Unfortunately, this new teacher was not proficient in in web design, and the course was a
            repeat of my high school class. Disappointed, I began looking into new schools to attend, because although I
            was learning a lot about design in general, I wanted to focus more on the web, and I knew that I was not going
            to be able to do so at SAA. So thats when I enrolled at Full Sail, and I've honestly been in love with it ever since.

        <h2> Component One: Quick View Hover</h2>
        <img src="images/comp1.jpg">

        <h3> What I hope to learn</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to learn how to create an image gallery that when hovered over, a new set of images appear, with each
            image being a link to it.
        </p>

        <h3> How this relates to what I've already learned</h3>
        <p>
             This relates to what I've already learned because I know how to create image hover states and how to style those.
            This will also be a good development skill to have as many clothing and sales companies use this similar
            design to display their products.
        </p>

        <ul class="buttom">

    <section>
        <h2> Component Two: Drop Down Menu</h2>
        <img src="images/comp2.jpg">
        <h3> What I hope to learn</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to learn how to properly set up a drop down menu using jQuery and CSS. This was a task that was taught
            in a previous class, but the only way I could get it set up was by inserting script inside of my HTML document
            instead of it being in the JavaScript document.
        </p>

        <h3> How this relates to what I've already learned</h3>
        <p>
            Drop down menus are almost standard on most multi-page websites, and I feel it is important to learn how to correctly
            develop these. I know to start this, you will create a list that consists of nested list inside, and then you use
            CSS styling and jQuery calls to make it appear as a standard drop down menu.
        </p>

        <ul class="buttom">
            <li> <a href="components/2/component.html" target="_blank"> View Component</a> </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Component Three: Shortcut Tab</h2>
        <img src="images/comp3.jpg">
        <h3> What I hope to learn</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to learn how to create a task bar that stays at the bottom of your web page, that when clicked, it will
            expand up and give you options to follow links or to chat with some one (right side of image).
        </p>

        <h3> How this relates to what I've already learned</h3>
        <p>
           This relates to what I've already learned because this element is essentially a reverse drop down menu, that is
            anchored to the bottom of a web page, but is always displayed on screen. I hope that by learning this,
            I will also be better versed in creating drop down menus (or in this, pop up menus) and also in creating elements
            of a web page that will always be visible on screen.
        </p>
        <ul class="buttom">
            <li> <a href="components/3/component.html" target="_blank"> View Component</a> </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Component Four (Featured) : Responsive Absolute Posistion Navigation </h2>
        <img src="images/comp4.jpg">
        <h3> What I hope to learn</h3>
        <p>
             I hope to learn how to create a navigation bar that is responsive, and also absolute in its position, meaning that it will always be
            seen on screen by the user. Learning how to create this will help me in the future create better one page websites
            because then the user can always click to where they wish to go, instead of scrolling up and down to find the navigation
            or the information that they were looking for.
        </p>

        <h3> How this relates to what I've already learned</h3>
        <p>
            This is another element that I feel has almost became a web design standard, because it can be commonly found o
            on several web pages. I already know how to create navigation bars using standard lists, but I feel that learning
            how to create something like this is another skill that clients will be interested in me having.
        </p>

        <h3> How I might build this</h3>
       <ol>
           <li id="even"> 1. Create your menu list in HTML </li>
           <li id="odd"> 2. In CSS, style list so that it is displayed as "inline" and give it other styles that you want</li>
           <li id="even"> 3. In CSS, make the navigation menus position fixed. </li>
           <li id="odd"> 4. At the bottom of the CSS file, create your responsive librarys, and style navigation to click
           into the size you want when the screen reaches that size you want. </li>
       </ol>

        <h2> Component Five: Facebook Feed</h2>
        <img src="images/comp5.jpg">
        <h3> What I hope to learn</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to learn how correctly use the Facebook API in order to insert a Facebook feed and like button into my web pages.
            This was another subject that I struggled with in a previous class because I had a hard time reading the API d
            document.
        </p>

        <h3> How this relates to what I've already learned</h3>
        <p>
            I have already learned the basics of how to use API's, but as I stated above, I really want to learn how to use
            them more efficiently and correctly.
